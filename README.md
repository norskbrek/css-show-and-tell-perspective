# CSS Show and Tell

Research something related to CSS!

1. Create a new GitHub repository with a quick demo or example code (HTML/CSS) showing what you researched. 
  > Not all things are easy to demonstrate but come up with something. A visual helps convey what it is you researched.
2. Update the README.md file in your repository to include a short 2-3 sentence description of your topic & any links or references that were helpful in your research. 
3. Start a thread in Slack with a link to your example GitHub repo to share what you've learned! 
  > If you start the thread, please pin it! If a thread is already out there, please reply to it.
4. Submit the assignment with a link to your GitHub repository.
