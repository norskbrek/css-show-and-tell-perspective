# CSS Show and Tell: Skew Transformation

I wanted to look at transformations in CSS. There are both 3D and 2D transformations in CSS; transformations can be used to adjust perspective and to flip, scale, rotate, and skew elements (they work for both text and images). I imagine transformations were used to make wonderful GeoCities animations long, long ago. 

Skew basically makes an image look like it's in mid-rotation - like a screen-shot from a stop-motion animation. (The [Google] definition of skew is: "neither parallel nor at right angles to a specified or implied line"). These images can be "skewed" along the X-or Y-axis, or both; skew is a "transformation method" that can take X-or Y-axis degree arguments.
